## üè≠ ABOUT

### Reusable Cup Quality Management System

This project is a comprehensive automated quality management system for reusable cups. Built upon the IFRA-Cranfield conveyor belt plugin, it implements specialized quality management features for reusable containers.

### Key Features

- **Automatic Loading**: Automatic cup generation and placement from Loader
- **QR Code Scanning**: Cup identification and history tracking
- **Computer Vision Inspection**: Automatic defect detection using cameras
- **Real-time Monitoring**: "Defect Detected / No Defects" status display
- **Automatic Sorting**: 
  - Rewash: Partially contaminated cups ‚Üí Re-washing line
  - Discard: Completely damaged cups ‚Üí Disposal processing

## ÔøΩÔøΩ INSTALLATION

This project has been developed and tested on Ubuntu 22.04 with ROS 2 Humble.

```sh
cd ~/dev_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Yobel_Conveyor.git
cd ~/dev_ws
colcon build
```

## üéØ USAGE

* If you make any edits in the gazebo models, you have to do 
colcon build again!!
    ```sh
    colcon build
    ```

0. Run the below command first:

    ```sh
    source ~/dev_ws/install/setup.bash
    ```

1. Launch the ConveyorBelt Gazebo environment:

    ```sh
    ros2 launch conveyorbelt_gazebo conveyorbelt.launch.py
    ```

<!-- 2. (1) Spawn the box on top of the Belt:
  <Higher Drop>
    ```sh
    ros2 run ros2_conveyorbelt SpawnObject.py --package "conveyorbelt_gazebo" --urdf "box.urdf" --name "box" --x 0.0 --y -0.5 --z 1.0
    ```
  <Exact Point Drop>
    ```sh
    ros2 run ros2_conveyorbelt SpawnObject.py --package "conveyorbelt_gazebo" --urdf "box.urdf" --name "box" --x 0.0 --y -0.5 --z 0.76
    ``` -->

2. Activate the ConveyorBelt with the desired speed -> Value = (0,100]:

    ```sh
    ros2 service call /CONVEYORPOWER conveyorbelt_msgs/srv/ConveyorBeltControl "{power: 20}"
    ```

3. Spawn the cup on top of the Belt - Enter below at 20.4XX sec (simulation time):
    ```sh
    ros2 run ros2_conveyorbelt_py cup_spawner
    ```

4. Spawn the monitor that shows defect/good cup images alternatively (when the cup passes the last LED):
    ```sh
    ros2 run ros2_conveyorbelt_py monitor_swapper
    ```

## References

This project is based on and extends the following open-source repositories:

### Primary Reference
- **[IFRA-Cranfield/IFRA_ConveyorBelt](https://github.com/IFRA-Cranfield/IFRA_ConveyorBelt)**: The core conveyor belt simulation functionality is based on this ROS2-Gazebo plugin developed by the IFRA (Intelligent Flexible Robotics and Assembly) Group at Cranfield University. This repository provides the fundamental conveyor belt simulation capabilities that have been enhanced for reusable cup quality management.

### Original IFRA Project References
The IFRA_ConveyorBelt project itself was developed with references to:
- **[usnistgov/ARIAC](https://github.com/usnistgov/ARIAC)**: Reference for implementing a ConveyorBelt simulation with a ROS2 Plugin, adapted from the "ariac2023" branch for IFRA ROS2 Robot Simulation in Gazebo.
- **[rokokoo/gconveyor-demo](https://github.com/rokokoo/conveyor_demo)**: The CAD file (mesh) of the ConveyorBelt used in the original demo was sourced from this repository.
